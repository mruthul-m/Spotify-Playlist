Hello ðŸ˜ƒ,
This is a simple project for creating your own spotify playlist and adding songs to it.

1. First of all you need a spotify account, If you dont already have an account don't worry,
   you can signup up for a free one here: [http://spotify.com/signup/](http://spotify.com/signup/)

2. Once you signed up/ signed in, go to the [developer dash board](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/)

3. Once you've created a Spotify app, copy the Client ID and Client Secret into the main.py.

4. Authenticating with Spotify is quite complicated, especially when you want to access a user's account. So instead, we're going to use one of the most popular Python Spotify modules - [Spotipy](https://pypi.org/project/spotipy/) to make things easier.

Songs are scrapped in [billboard](https://www.billboard.com)
